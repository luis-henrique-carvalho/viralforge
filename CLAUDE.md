# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository. Current-state only —
design history and rationale live in `docs/` (see the pointers at the bottom).

## Project

ClippyMe is a self-hosted AI video platform that turns long-form videos
(YouTube or local uploads) into viral 9:16 vertical shorts. Fork of OpenShorts.
Backend: FastAPI + a subprocess video pipeline. Frontend: React 18 + Vite 6 +
Tailwind v4.

## Repo layout

Python backend is src-layout under `src/clippyme/` (`pip install -e .`):

- `api/` — `app.py` (thin FastAPI layer: job-lifecycle routes, middleware,
  static mounts, lifespan), `config_routes.py` (the config-family `APIRouter`:
  keys/cookies/fonts/logo/zernio/models — routes that touch no job runtime
  state, `include_router`ed by app.py), `discovery_routes.py` (multi-platform
  video discovery: legacy sync search + asynchronous `DiscoveryWorker` queue,
  cancellation and saved search history), `schemas.py` (Pydantic request models),
  `security.py` (trusted-origin/rate limit/API-token gates).
- `domain/` — endpoint logic. `clip_resolve.py` (shared `resolve_clip()`: job
  dir → latest metadata → clip entry → path, used by every per-clip endpoint),
  `job_submission.py` (`submit_job()` + queue-full rollback),
  `job_runner.py` (`make_run_job()` — the per-job subprocess loop),
  `job_actions.py` (cancel/stop bodies), `job_journal.py` (crash-safe queue
  journal + startup recovery), `job_worker.py` (queue dispatch + retention
  cleanup), `job_results.py` (`build_main_cmd`, partial/final result loaders),
  `job_artifacts.py` (atomic metadata IO), `runtime_state.py` (durable per-job
  phase/progress/attempt state in `<job>/.clippyme_runtime.json` + the
  `.clippyme_checkpoint/` artefact dir — atomic + fsync'd, owner-only),
  `uploads.py` (local-file intake: size cap, safe destination paths),
  `job_control.py` (status machine +
  psutil process-tree suspend/resume), `publish_service.py` (Zernio publish
  flow), `compose.py` (layer pipeline), `clip_endpoints.py` (smart-cut runner,
  history restore), `smartcut.py` (impure orchestrator: ffmpeg/auto-editor
  render, ffprobe, per-clip locks, `smart_cut`) + `smartcut_ops.py` (pure,
  host-tested: filler index, drop-range math, `analyze_silences`, v3 timeline
  builder — re-exported by smartcut.py for back-compat), `subtitles.py`,
  `hooks.py`, `logo.py`, `banner.py` (attribution banner: platform logo +
  handle, `suggest_banner` URL parsing, lazy-cairosvg raster, `attach`
  letterbox positioning), `live_monitor.py` (`LiveMonitorRegistry` +
  per-platform strategies: multi-channel Kick/Twitch/YouTube monitor, live +
  vod modes, global `picked_slots` publish spacing, state in
  `data/live_monitor.json`; durable auto-resume via `resume_on_start`;
  runtime config updates `POST /api/live-monitor/{id}/config` (allow-listed
  fields, apply to future clips); per-segment clip selection
  (`clip_selection: fixed|auto` — `fixed` publishes the top `max_clips` by
  viral_score, `auto` adds a `min_viral_score` floor via
  `CLIPPYME_MIN_VIRAL_SCORE` so a weak segment yields fewer clips or none,
  with `max_clips` staying the ceiling — `max_clips: 0` means NO cap and rides
  through as `CLIPPYME_MAX_CLIPS=0`, which the orchestrator reads as uncapped);
  per-monitor `smart_cut` (opt-in — adds
  the `smartcut` toggle to the auto-publish compose recipe) and
  `letterbox_zoom` (monitors always render reframe-`disabled`);
  start-time `catchup: backfill|live_only` (live mode only — VOD processes
  whole feed items, so the UI hides it); `prelive_skip_seconds` applies to VOD
  jobs too on Kick/Twitch (their VODs open on the same waiting screen) via
  `build_main_cmd(start_offset=)` → `--start-offset` → the orchestrator's
  stream-copy head trim, never on YouTube uploads;
  publishing pause/resume `POST /api/live-monitor/{id}/publishing` with a
  persisted pending queue that auto-drains on resume/restart; after a
  confirmed Zernio publish the clip's artifacts are deleted and its metadata
  entry marked `deleted_after_publish` — positions in `shorts` stay stable,
  consumers pass `original_index`),
  `grade.py`, `clip_qa.py`, `clip_edit_ai.py`, `history_service.py`,
  `encode.py` (single source of x264 settings for every render pass),
  `viral_studio_context.py` (multi-signal context extraction: keyframes, audio transcript, metadata & engagement),
  `viral_studio_copy.py` (multimodal copy generation with Gemini fallback, inline JPEG parts, full token/cost telemetry),
  `viral_studio_download.py` (yt-dlp intake preserving source provenance, manifest, and engagement metrics),
  `viral_studio_orchestrator.py` (step logging `append_item_log` and batch lifecycle orchestration),
  `viral_studio_store.py` (atomic crash-safe JSON store with `_STORE_LOCK` and 0o600 permissions),
  `discovery/` — multi-platform video discovery: `service.py` (search and scoring orchestrator),
  `store.py` (atomic crash-safe store in `data/discovery/{id}.json` with lightweight `searches_index.json`
  and batch URL cross-referencing for `already_imported`), `worker.py` (`DiscoveryWorker`: `asyncio.Queue`,
  global `Semaphore(2)` + isolated per-platform locks `_platform_locks`, in-flight task cancellation with immediate
  semaphore return, startup recovery), `schemas.py` (`DiscoverySearch`, `DiscoverySearchStatus`, `ImportProvenance`),
  `errors.py` (domain exceptions mapped to HTTP by one app-level handler).
- `pipeline/` — `orchestrator.py` (**the entrypoint queued jobs actually run**:
  preflight → checkpointed `main.py` stages → per-render output QA; owns
  retries, resume and `.clippyme_runtime.json`), `preflight.py` (pure-ish
  pre-spend probe: duration/size/disk/Gemini-cost estimate + quota rejection,
  exit code 2 = never retried), `media_qa.py` (ffprobe clip verification:
  streams, aspect, black/freeze ratio, loudness), `quality_suite.py`
  (manifest-driven regression runner replaying the production QA policy —
  path-confined to the manifest dir), `main.py` (CLI orchestrator — still owns
  transcription/Gemini/cut/reframe), `reframe.py` (orchestrator:
  scene analysis, frame strategies, render loops, `process_video_to_vertical`),
  `reframe_track.py` (pure tracking classes — host-tested, no cv2),
  `reframe_detect.py` (YOLO/MediaPipe detectors), `reframe_ops.py` (pure
  camera math), `cut_ops.py` (clip-edge snapping primitives + the
  `snap_clips_to_transcript`/`compute_neighbor_bounds` batch orchestration),
  `run_ops.py` (pure entrypoint helpers: `resolve_output_dir`,
  `build_cut_command`), `gemini_request.py` (prompt template + pricing +
  prompt/cost/retry-classification — the pure half of `get_viral_clips`; the
  prompt's `TITLE & CAPTION COPY` section is engagement-first by design
  (see `docs/title-hook-copy-research.md`) — never reintroduce a mechanical
  CTA there, and `CLIPPYME_CREATOR_NAME` names the clip's subject without
  ever overriding the speaker-attribution rule; the
  per-word payload is TOON-encoded (`encode_words_toon`, ~50% smaller than
  JSON) while the response contract stays JSON),
  `media_probe.py` (ffprobe + silencedetect wrappers), `texttiling_ops.py`
  (no-AI topic-segmentation fallback), `deepgram_transcribe.py`,
  `elevenlabs_transcribe.py`, `gemini_service.py`, `gemini_parser.py`,
  `scene_detection.py`, `download.py`, `postprocess.py`, `diarization.py`,
  `hardware.py`, `transcribe_cache.py`. `main.py` imports cv2/torch at the
  top → NOT host-importable: pure logic goes in the modules above, never
  inline in `main.py` (it re-imports moved names for back-compat).
- `netutil.py` — bounded DNS resolution (daemon thread + timeout) shared by
  the SSRF guards in `download.py` / `social_publisher.py`; never mutate
  `socket.setdefaulttimeout` (it doesn't even apply to `getaddrinfo`).
- `integrations/` — `social_publisher.py` (Zernio client + SmartScheduler),
  `auto_editor_updater.py` (auto-editor binary self-update),
  `kick_client.py` (Kick channel/VOD JSON via curl_cffi, Cloudflare profile
  rotation), `twitch_client.py` (Helix app-token client: streams/users/videos),
  `youtube_feed.py` (UULF long-form RSS polling — Shorts structurally
  excluded).
- `storage/` — `config_store.py` (persisted config in `data/config.json`).

Frontend lives entirely in `dashboard/src/redesign/` (`main.jsx` renders
`RedesignApp`). Shared hooks in `dashboard/src/hooks/` (incl.
`useManualTrim.js` — the modal's trim state machine), pure logic in
`dashboard/src/lib/` (incl. `applyEdit.js` — the reprocess orchestration,
`seedClipParams.js`, `trimSelection.js`, `bulkApply.js`, `taste.js`).
Subtitle/logo/grade controls are SHARED between the Create recipe and the
EditClipModal via `subtitleControls.jsx` / `layerControls.jsx` (hookStyle.jsx
pattern: fully-controlled `value` + `onChange(partial)`, per-surface `variant`
chrome, defaults resolved by thin adapters) — never re-clone these controls
per surface. `captions.jsx` is the modal shell; tab bodies live in
`editTabs.jsx` with state lifted in the shell (tabs are conditionally
rendered).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): backend host suite (with report-only
coverage) + ruff bug-class rules + blocking `pip-audit`; frontend lint +
**test** (with coverage) + build; the Docker integration job runs on main
pushes or `workflow_dispatch`, pre-building the backend image with GHA layer
caching (tagged `clippyme-backend` so compose reuses it).

## Architecture

**Job lifecycle**: `POST /api/process|/api/batch` → `build_main_cmd` →
`submit_job` (in-memory `jobs` dict + `asyncio.Queue`) → `process_queue`
dispatch (semaphore, `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`) → `run_job` spawns
`python -m clippyme.pipeline.orchestrator` as a subprocess and polls partial
results every 2s. Statuses: `queued → processing ⇄ paused → {completed, failed,
cancelled, stopped}` (`job_control.py` owns the guards). `stopped` keeps
finished clips; `cancelled` rmtree's everything.

**Runtime resilience**: the orchestrator (not `main.py`) is what queued jobs
execute. It preflights the source, keeps durable state + reusable artefacts in
the job dir, retries transient failures with bounded backoff
(`CLIPPYME_JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, exit code `2` = deterministic rejection, never
retried), resumes after a backend restart when state + source are still safe,
and QA-probes every temporary render before it atomically replaces the public
clip (structural defect → bounded re-render; signal finding → metadata
warning). Telemetry rides `result.operations` on the status response. Full
reference: `docs/runtime-quality.md`.

**Job journal**: every status transition writes `data/jobs_journal.json`
(atomic, ACTIVE jobs only — never env secrets/Popen/logs). On startup,
`lifespan` recovery re-enqueues `queued` jobs, restores interrupted jobs whose
final result reached disk, and marks the rest `failed` (killing orphaned
pipeline trees via psutil with an argv-match guard). **`failed` is reused
deliberately**: the frontend poller terminates only on
`completed|stopped|cancelled|failed` — an unknown status polls forever.

**Pipeline (per job)**: yt-dlp download → transcription → PySceneDetect →
Gemini viral detection (5-level JSON-repair fallback chain in
`gemini_parser.py`; TextTiling topic-split as the no-AI fallback; whole-video
render as the last resort) → per-clip edge snapping (word → sentence →
waveform-silence, `cut_ops.py`) → 9:16 reframe → Ken Burns zoom (folded into
the master encode) → EBU R128 loudnorm → cover frame. The 16:9 source slice
per clip is preserved on disk (`source_*.mp4`) to enable post-hoc reframe
switching. Clip files are named from the sanitized Gemini viral title
(`run_ops.clip_output_basename`: Windows-forbidden chars/reserved names
handled, always suffixed `_clip_{i+1}`); the basename is persisted per clip
as `clip_filename` in metadata (re-dumped atomically per cut iteration) and
every consumer resolves through `clip_resolve.clip_filename_for`
(clip_filename → video_url → positional legacy fallback).

**Transcription & Hardware Acceleration**: `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` = `deepgram` (default, Nova-3
REST) | `elevenlabs` (Scribe; audio-event tags feed the Gemini prompt) |
`whisper` (local). Both cloud providers silently fall back to Whisper on any
failure. All paths transcribe an extracted mono-16kHz FLAC, not the video.
Transcripts are cached 7 days under `data/cache/` keyed by URL hash.
- **Compute Architecture & Dynamic Routing**:
  - **Whisper Speech-to-Text**: Managed dynamically by `resolve_whisper_compute(ai_model)`.
    - When using **Cloud AI APIs** (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI): Whisper automatically runs on **GPU (`cuda`)** (PyTorch ROCm `openai-whisper` on AMD or `faster-whisper` on NVIDIA) scaled by VRAM ($\ge$12GB: `large-v3`, $\ge$6GB: `medium`, <6GB: `small`).
    - When using **Local LLMs** (LM Studio, Ollama): Whisper runs on **CPU (`cpu`)** to avoid VRAM exhaustion and GPU contention, scaled by system RAM ($\ge$16GB: `medium`, $\ge$8GB: `small`, <8GB: `base`).
    - **Fallback**: GPU errors fall back to CPU automatically.
    - **Overrides**: `WHISPER_DEVICE` and `WHISPER_MODEL` in `.env` override dynamic selection.
  - **GPU Acceleration (Vision & Render)**: AMD (ROCm / HIP) and NVIDIA (CUDA) remain active for YOLO person/face tracking, PyTorch vision tensors, and video encoding.

**Compose** (`POST /api/compose/{job}/{clip}`): layers render in the order
**Grade → Subtitles → Smart Cut → Hook → Logo → Banner**. Do NOT reorder —
subtitles are burned before Smart Cut so their absolute timing can't drift;
grade runs first so overlays keep authored colour; logo sits on top; the
attribution banner (`banner.py`: platform logo + handle, `attach` mode pins it
under the letterbox band when `reframe_mode == disabled`) renders topmost as a
separate pass. Grade+subtitles and hook+logo are pass-fused (one encode each)
when possible. Toggles are UI-only state; composition happens at
download/publish time. Serialised per clip via `clip_locks.clip_lock`.
Hook overlay shows only the first 4s of the clip, EXCEPT
`reframe_mode == disabled` where it stays for the whole clip. An ANIMATED hook
needs `-loop 1` on the PNG input + `-shortest` (a single image frame + `fade`
= alpha 0 forever, i.e. no hook at all). With `reframe_mode == disabled` and
NO banner, bottom captions re-anchor to the top of the black band
(`compose._letterbox_caption_band_top` → `generate_ass_karaoke(band_top=)`) so
they sit just under the video instead of floating low in the black.

**Reframe**: three user modes — `auto` (face tracking + per-scene strategy),
`subject` (FrameShift weighted-interest crop; legacy alias `object`),
`disabled` (letterbox — the WHOLE frame between black bars, nothing cropped;
`--letterbox-zoom` / `letterbox_zoom` optionally trims 5–15% off the width for
a fixed zoom, geometry in the pure `reframe_ops.letterbox_plan`).
`disabled` also forces the Ken Burns push OFF (`zoom_end=None` in
`process_video_to_vertical`) — a locked frame must not drift.
Comfort mode is default-on: within a scene the camera
never moves (`collapse_scene_targets`), zoom locks per scene. The output
aspect is an explicit `process_video_to_vertical(..., aspect_ratio=)`
parameter passed by `main.py` per job — there is no module-global. Post-hoc
mode switching (`POST /api/reframe/{job}/{clip}`) spawns
`main.py --reframe-only` on the preserved source slice. Camera/decision math
lives in `reframe_ops.py`/`reframe_track.py` (pure, host-tested) — add new
reframe logic there, not in the cv2-bound modules.
⚠️ `REFRAME_GLOBAL_METHOD=kalman|l2` only runs with `REFRAME_STATIC_AUTO=0`;
the default static-auto policy never reaches the trajectory smoother.

**Smart Cut**: transcript-driven silence/filler removal rendered via a
hand-built auto-editor v3 JSON timeline (ffmpeg concat fallback if the binary
is missing), plus an audio-threshold polish pass. Manual trims arrive as
`drop_ranges` ([[start,end], …] clip-relative) and ride compose + publish.
The auto-editor binary is NOT a pip dep — Dockerfile downloads it; an opt-in
24h self-update loop refreshes it (`AUTO_EDITOR_AUTO_UPDATE=1`).

**Publish**: Zernio (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube). `publish_service.publish_clip_flow`
optionally re-composes first so uploads match the preview; `SmartScheduler`
picks Italian-prime-time slots with anti-collision. Zernio error bodies pass
through verbatim (the frontend parses per-platform 429 daily limits).

## Code rules

- **Thin handlers**: validate → call a `clippyme.domain.*` helper → return
  JSON. A handler growing past ~25 lines of logic gets extracted. Domain
  modules never import FastAPI — they raise `errors.ClippyMeError` subclasses
  (`ValidationError` 400, `NotFoundError` 404, `ConflictError` 409) mapped by
  one app-level handler.
- **Per-clip endpoints resolve through `clip_resolve.resolve_clip()`** — do
  not re-implement the metadata/filename fallback chain.
- **Pure logic is extracted to host-testable modules** (no cv2/torch imports)
  so it runs in `pytest -m "not integration"`. cv2/ML code is verified only by
  the Docker integration suite.
- **Back-compat re-exports**: `reframe.py` re-exports the moved
  track/detect names; `main.py` re-exports the reframe API. Keep them when
  moving code.
- **Atomic writes** for anything on disk that a crash could corrupt
  (`job_artifacts.save_job_metadata` pattern: tmp + `os.replace`, 0o600).
- **Quality and Config Immutability**: NEVER modify, loosen, or bypass linter rules, TypeScript/tsconfig options, Vitest coverage thresholds, or test configs (e.g. `eslint.config.*`, `tsconfig*.json`, `vitest.config.*`, `scripts/verify.sh`) to silence errors. Fix the source code or test implementation instead.
- **Host Test Isolation from Persistent Disk State**: Host unit tests verifying environment resolution, factory fallbacks, or default providers (e.g. `get_social_publisher`, `config_routes`) must strictly isolate from disk configurations by monkeypatching `load_persistent_config` and `load_zernio_config` to `{}` or test fixtures, preventing developer-local `data/config.json` state from leaking into assertions.
- **Graphify-First Exploration**: ALWAYS use `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify explain "<concept>"`, or `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` as the primary search and navigation mechanism for codebase architecture and relationships before falling back to raw grep searches. Run `graphify update .` after code modifications.
- **Frontend Web (web/) — 100% Shadcn-First Compliance**: Always compose UI features from official Shadcn UI primitives located in `@/components/ui/*` (`Typography`, `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Switch`, `Select`, `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `ScrollArea`, `Separator`, etc.). Never create raw HTML buttons/inputs or custom primitive widgets that duplicate Shadcn functionality, nor raw typography tags (`<h1-h6>`, `<p>`, `<blockquote>`). If a specialized UI component is truly needed that cannot be built with standard Shadcn components, you MUST explicitly request user authorization before creating it.
  - **Canonical Typography Standard**: Always use `<Typography variant="...">` from `@/components/ui/typography.tsx`. Never pass ad-hoc inline font/color overrides (e.g. `text-xs text-muted-foreground`) when canonical variants (`variant="muted"`, `variant="small"`, `variant="destructive"`, `variant="h1-h4"`) exist.
  - Every frontend feature must pass `./scripts/check_shadcn_usage.py` with 0 warnings.
- **Frontend Quality & Chart Key Semantics**: Respect max 80 lines per function, max 200 lines per component, zero `any` in TypeScript, and strict TanStack Router / TanStack Query separation (`views/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `data/`). Chart tooltips, legends, and mapped collections must always use unique string identifiers (`key={key}`) instead of array indices or union-type properties, ensuring zero `react/no-array-index-key` warnings and strict React 19 type safety.
- **Security & Port-Agnostic Local Loopback Origins**: `job_id` regex-validated everywhere; config/state endpoints require a trusted origin or private-network client. In `security.py`, `is_trusted_origin()` must dynamically accept any port on localhost / loopback hostnames (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) via URL hostname parsing (in addition to explicit `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env vars), preventing false-positive HTTP 403 CSRF blocks when the frontend dev server is allocated an alternate local port (e.g. 5174, 3000, 8080). `SafeStaticFiles` blocks `*_metadata.json` and `source_*` from the `/videos` mount; secrets never enter the job journal; `tmp/` is gitignored and must never be committed. Pre-commit secret scan: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. With `TRUST_PROXY=1`, `client_ip` reads the **last** `X-Forwarded-For` hop (the shipped nginx APPENDS via `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`).
- **Viral Content Studio Rules**:
  * `viral_studio_context.py`: Extract multi-signal context (yt-dlp title/caption/tags, keyframe JPEGs downscaled to ~512px saved under `/videos/viral_studio/<batch>/<item>/keyframes/`, speech transcript, engagement metrics `view_count`, `like_count`, `comment_count`, `repost_count`). `_extract_audio_transcript` must use dynamic import to stay host-testable without cv2/torch.
  * `viral_studio_copy.py`: Multimodal copy generation supporting Gemini, LM Studio, and Ollama. Passes inline JPEG parts (`types.Part.from_bytes`) + context summary, guaranteeing zero product hallucinations. Persists full LLM telemetry (`model`, `prompt_tokens`, `candidate_tokens`, `estimated_cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `prompt`, `raw_response`) to `viral_studio_store`. Local inference clients (LM Studio / Ollama) MUST use a >= 300s timeout to accommodate 27B+ reasoning/CoT models.
  * `job_runner.py` Failure Propagation: Subprocess exits with non-zero returncodes (including SIGSEGV 139 / GPU coredump) MUST sync terminal `FAILED` state to `viral_studio_store` and append structured `ERROR` telemetry so items never stay stuck in `ANALYZING` or `DOWNLOADING`.
  * **Frontend Observability & Model Resolution**: `ViralEditModal.jsx` provides a dedicated 3-view Observability Hub (`Sinais Extraídos`, `Telemetria da LLM`, `Linha do Tempo`). The telemetry view must resolve `item.model` or `AI_ROUTING` logs directly and display waiting dashes (`—`) for pending metrics rather than hardcoding cloud model fallbacks or zeroed stats. Model selection from `createBatch` must thread through all API/orchestrator layers without drop.
- **Media & Video Card UI/UX Rules (Hero-First & Anti-Gap)**:
  * **Video as Hero**: Vertical 9:16 video cards must lead with the video preview. Never nest media inside bloated `CardHeader` containers with double borders. Overlay identifiers, SKU tags, selection checkboxes, and status badges directly atop the video preview using frosted-glass badges (`bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20`).
  * **Anti-Gap Grid Alignment**: Media grids must use `items-start` to avoid forced row-stretching. Cards must avoid `justify-between` or unconstrained `flex-1` spacers that cause cavernous empty voids when sibling cards have varying content.
  * **Uniform-Height Action Slots**: Every card lifecycle state (`APPROVED`, `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, `FAILED`, `PROCESSING`) must occupy an identical fixed-height footer slot (e.g. `h-7` or `h-8`). Never leave approved cards without a symmetrical status pill (`✓ Vídeo Aprovado`) matching the primary CTA button height of pending cards.
- **Visual Template & TemplateStudio Rules**:
  * `VisualTemplate` Schema: Autonomous domain aggregate combining visual geometry (1080x1920 logical space) and editorial intelligence (`generation_tasks: List[GenerationTask]`). Strictly decoupled from `Brand`. The `conversion_goal` field (`engagement` vs `affiliate`) dictates copy behavior: `engagement` forbids product codes and bio links, directing CTA to retention/comments.
  * `viral_studio_copy.py` (`CopyEngine`): Deep module. Assembles prompts dynamically from `template.generation_tasks`, builds on-demand JSON schemas containing only active task keys, interpolates variables (`{transcript}`, `{brand_name}`, `{cta}`), runs 5-level JSON repair, and populates `AICopyData` (`headlines`, `caption`, `custom_outputs: Dict[str, Any]`). Host-testable via pure functions without GPU/network.
  * `viral_studio_renderer.py`: Deep module. Enforces even coordinates and dimensions (`coord - (coord % 2)`) for libx264/YUV420p macroblock compatibility. Composes Pillow overlays (avatar, handle, badge at `badge_y`, headline at `headline_y` with `headline_alignment` support: left vs center) and applies video border-radius masks and extra image/footer overlays before final FFmpeg encoding.
    * **Emoji Rendering Invariants**: Renders full-color emojis via `pilmoji` + `Twemoji`. Any custom emoji source class MUST subclass `BaseSource` directly (e.g. `class _CachedTwemojiSource(Twemoji):`) — object composition fails Pilmoji's internal `isinstance` check and silently falls back to Pillow's `.notdef` tofu box. Downloaded emoji PNGs must be cached locally in `data/cache/emojis/`. Line wrapping and centering must always calculate text width via `_measure_text_width` / `Pilmoji.getsize()` to account for emoji glyph bounding boxes.
    * **1:1 Visual Parity Guarantee**: The Pillow/FFmpeg video overlay generator must mathematically match the `react-konva` 9:16 interactive canvas preview 1:1 in geometry, font sizes, positioning (`badge_y`, `headline_y`, `extra_image_x/y`), alignment, border widths, corner radiuses, and default background colors (`#0D1117`).
  * `TemplateStudio` (`TemplateEditorModal.jsx`): Dual-pane workstation powered by `react-konva` in canonical 1080x1920 space. Features free-layer dragging, magnetic central snap guide at X=540px, video vertical height handles (400-1500px), aspect ratio presets (`1:1`, `4:5`, `16:9`), border styling, and footer image uploads. Aba 2 contains the `+ Adicionar Tarefa de IA` catalog. All canvas element readers must use defensive fallbacks (`?.value ?? default`) to prevent unhandled runtime exceptions from collapsing layers to `(0, 0)`.
  * Canonical Prototypes: Use `docs/prototypes/viral-studio-template-simulation.html` (canvas mechanics) and `docs/prototypes/dynamic-generation-tasks-simulation.html` (AI tasks & dynamic schema) as visual and interaction benchmarks, while strictly applying the project's official theme (`tokens.css` + `app.css` / Shadcn).
- **Docker Host UID & Reload Workflow**:
  * `docker-entrypoint.sh` dynamically synchronizes container `appuser` with the host user's UID/GID (`stat -c '%u' /app`) at boot, ensuring all state files (`0o600`) in `data/` and `output/` belong to the developer on the host machine without permission errors.
  * Because backend `uvicorn` in Docker runs without `--reload`, **always run `docker restart clippyme-backend`** after modifying backend Python files so the running uvicorn process reloads updated Pydantic schemas and route handlers.
- **Social Publishing & Auto-Chaining (Ports & Adapters)**:
  * `SocialPublisherPort` (`clippyme.domain.social_publisher_port`): Core domain port for social distribution (`publish`, `schedule`, `cancel`, `get_status`, `list_accounts`). No domain or route code may import provider SDKs directly.
  * `ZernioPublisherAdapter`: Production adapter integrating with Zernio API with presigned streaming upload, SSRF checks, 429 rate-limit mapping to `ValidationError`, and log secret sanitization.
  * `MockPublisherAdapter`: Deterministic in-memory test double for offline execution and fast host tests.
  * Provider Resolution (`get_social_publisher`): Resolves provider via `PUBLISHING_PROVIDER` config, explicit `provider=` argument, or safe mock fallback.
  * Intelligent Gap-Filling Scheduling (`get_next_available_slots`): Evaluates candidate dates starting from earliest possible (`now.date()`), filling intermediate cancelled slots before advancing past the tail of the queue (`occupied_dates`). Every account projection is fully isolated.
- **Asynchronous Discovery & Mining Worker (`DiscoveryWorker`)**:
  * `POST /api/discovery/searches` responds immediately with HTTP 202 Accepted (`QUEUED`).
  * `DiscoveryWorker` runs on the event loop in `lifespan` with bounded concurrency via two-level controls: global `asyncio.Semaphore(2)` + isolated per-platform locks (`_platform_locks[platform]`), preventing IP bans, captchas, and bot detection on TikTok/Instagram.
  * In-Flight Cancellation: `POST /api/discovery/searches/{id}/cancel` cancels active `asyncio.Task`, aborts scraper execution, immediately releases the concurrency semaphore, and persists status `CANCELLED`.
  * Thin Handlers Invariant: aggregate instantiation and queuing MUST be encapsulated in `DiscoveryWorker.create_and_enqueue(filter_params)` and `DiscoverySearch.to_summary()`, keeping route handlers under 15 lines (`validate -> call domain -> return JSON`).
  * Atomic Persistence & Deduplication: Searches persist crash-safely in `data/discovery/{search_id}.json` with `searches_index.json` for lightweight history lookups. `mark_imported_status()` cross-references item URLs with existing batch stores to display `Já no Lote #X` in the UI.

## Configuration

API keys, Gemini model, transcription provider and cookies are managed from
the dashboard Settings tab (persisted in `data/config.json`, git-ignored).
The full operational env-var reference (REFRAME_*, AE_*, CLIPPYME_*,
DEEPGRAM_*, ELEVENLABS_*, ZERNIO_*, server knobs) lives in `.env.example`
(commented, with defaults) and the README table — keep those two in sync when
adding a knob. `GEMINI_MODEL` defaults to `gemini-3.5-flash`; per-job override
via `--model` / `ProcessRequest.model` (regex-validated against argv
injection).
